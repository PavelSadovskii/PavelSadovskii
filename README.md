# Data Science projects



| Project name | Description | Libraries used | Field of activity |
| :---------------------- | :---------------------- | :---------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
|1. [Research of reliability of borrowers](https://github.com/PavelSadovskii/Project1-Reliability-of-borrowers/blob/main/project1_eng.ipynb) | The customer is the credit department of the bank. It is necessary to find out whether the marital status and the number of children of the client affect the fact of repaying the loan on time. Input data from the bank - statistics on the solvency of customers. The results of the study will be taken into account when building a credit scoring model - a special system that assesses the ability of a potential borrower to return a loan to a bank.| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-brithgreen) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pandas-blue) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Preprocessing-3fcfd5) |`Banking`, `Bank lending` |
|2. [Game market research](https://github.com/PavelSadovskii/Project2-Games-Per-Platform/blob/main/project2_games_eng.ipynb) |You work in an online store that sells computer games worldwide. Historical game sales data, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms (such as Xbox or PlayStation) are available from public sources. You need to identify the patterns that determine the success of the game. This will allow you to bid on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns.| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-NumPy-orange) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-brithgreen) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pandas-blue) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-SciPy-4c9acb) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Seaborn-0b80ff) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-EDA-8f4bc1)  |`Business`, `Internet Services`, `Gamedev`|
|3. [Research of advertisements for the sale of apartments](https://github.com/PavelSadovskii/Project3-Real-Estate/blob/main/project3_real_estate_eng.ipynb)| At your disposal is the data of the Yandex.Realty service - an archive of ads for the sale of apartments in St. Petersburg and neighboring settlements for several years. You need to learn how to determine the market value of real estate. Your job is to set the parameters. This will allow to build an automated system: it will track anomalies and fraudulent activity.| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-brithgreen) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pandas-blue) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-nltk-orange) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Matplotlib-9cf) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Preprocessing-3fcfd5) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-EDA-8f4bc1)| `Internet Services`, `Ad platforms` |
|4. [Tariffs Recomendation](https://github.com/PavelSadovskii/Project4-Tariffs-Recomendation/blob/main/projects4_tariffs_eng.ipynb) | The mobile operator wants to build a system that can analyze customer behavior and offer a new tariff: "Smart" or "Ultra". The goal is to build a model for the classification task with the highest possible accuracy value, which will select the appropriate rate.| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-brithgreen) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pandas-blue) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-ScikitLearn-yellow) |`Telecom`, `Business`|
|5. [Customer churn prediction](https://github.com/PavelSadovskii/Project5-Banks/blob/main/project5_banks_eng.ipynb) |Customers began to leave Beta-Bank. Every month. A little, but noticeable. Banking marketers figured it was cheaper to keep current customers than to attract new ones. It is necessary to predict whether the client will leave the bank in the near future or not. You are provided with historical data on customer behavior and termination of agreements with the bank.| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-brithgreen) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pandas-blue) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-ScikitLearn-yellow) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Matplotlib-9cf) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-NumPy-orange) |`Business`, `Investments`, `Banking`, `Bank lending`|
|6. [Determination of the region for drilling a new well](https://github.com/PavelSadovskii/Project6-Oil-Production/blob/main/project6_oil_eng.ipynb) |We need to decide where to drill a new well. You have been provided with oil samples in three regions: in each of 10,000 fields, where the quality of oil and the volume of its reserves have been measured. Build a machine learning model to help determine the region where mining will bring the most profit. Analyze possible profits and risks using the Bootstrap technique.| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-brithgreen) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pandas-blue) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-ScikitLearn-yellow) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-NumPy-orange) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Matplotlib-9cf)  |`Mining companies`|
|7. [Recovery of gold from ore](https://github.com/PavelSadovskii/Project7-Gold-industry/blob/main/project7_gold_eng.ipynb) |Prepare a prototype machine learning model for the company. The company develops solutions for the efficient operation of industrial enterprises. The model should predict the recovery rate of gold from gold ore. Use data with mining and cleaning parameters. The model will help optimize production so as not to launch an enterprise with unprofitable characteristics.| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-brithgreen) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pandas-blue) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-NumPy-orange) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-ScikitLearn-yellow) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Matplotlib-9cf) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-EDA-8f4bc1) |`Industry` |
|8. [Protection of personal data of clients](https://github.com/PavelSadovskii/Project8-Personal-Data/blob/main/project8_personal_data_security_eng.ipynb) | You need to protect the data of customers of the insurance company "Though the Flood".

[Determining the cost of cars](https://github.com/PavelSadovskii/Project9-Car-Price/blob/main/project9_car_price_eng.ipynb) |Service for the sale of used cars "Not beaten, not repainted" is developing an application to attract new customers. In it, you can quickly find out the market value of your car. At your disposal are historical data: technical specifications, equipment and prices of cars. You need to build a model to determine the cost. The customer is important: prediction quality, prediction speed, studying time.| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-brithgreen) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pandas-blue) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-lightgbm-red) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-EDA-8f4bc1)|`Internet services`,`Online shopping`,`Business` |
