# Data Science projects



| Project name | Description | Libraries used | Field of activity |
| :---------------------- | :---------------------- | :---------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
|1. [Research of reliability of borrowers](https://github.com/PavelSadovskii/Project1-Reliability-of-borrowers/blob/main/project1_eng.ipynb) | The customer is the credit department of the bank. It is necessary to find out whether the marital status and the number of children of the client affect the fact of repaying the loan on time. Input data from the bank - statistics on the solvency of customers. The results of the study will be taken into account when building a credit scoring model - a special system that assesses the ability of a potential borrower to return a loan to a bank.| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-brithgreen) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pandas-blue) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Preprocessing-3fcfd5) |`Banking`, `Bank lending` |
|2. [Game market research](https://github.com/PavelSadovskii/Project2-Games-Per-Platform/blob/main/project2_games.ipynb) |You work in an online store that sells computer games worldwide. Historical game sales data, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms (such as Xbox or PlayStation) are available from public sources. You need to identify the patterns that determine the success of the game. This will allow you to bid on a potentially popular product and plan advertising campaigns.| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-NumPy-orange) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-brithgreen) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pandas-blue) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-SciPy-4c9acb) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Seaborn-0b80ff) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-EDA-8f4bc1)  |`Business`, `Internet Services`, `Gamedev`|
|3.

|5. [Comparison of music among residents of Moscow and St. Petersburg](https://github.com/PavelSadovskii/Project5-Music/blob/main/project5_music_msc_spb.ipynb) |The purpose of the study is to test three hypotheses: >User activity depends on the day of the week. Moreover, in Moscow and St. Petersburg this manifests itself in different ways. On Monday morning, certain genres dominate in Moscow, while others dominate in St. Petersburg. Similarly, Friday evenings are dominated by different genres, depending on the city. Moscow and St. Petersburg prefer different genres of music. In Moscow, they listen to pop music more often, in St. Petersburg - Russian rap.| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-brithgreen) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pandas-blue) |`Music`, `Business`|
|6. [Tariffs Recomendation](https://github.com/PavelSadovskii/Project6-Tariffs-Recomendation/blob/main/project6_tariffs_recomendation.ipynb) | The mobile operator wants to build a system that can analyze customer behavior and offer a new tariff: "Smart" or "Ultra". The goal is to build a model for the classification task with the highest possible accuracy value, which will select the appropriate rate.| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-brithgreen) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pandas-blue) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-ScikitLearn-yellow) |`Telecom`, `Business`|
|7. [Customer churn prediction](https://github.com/PavelSadovskii/Project7-Banks/blob/main/project7_banks.ipynb) |Customers began to leave Beta-Bank. Every month. A little, but noticeable. Banking marketers figured it was cheaper to keep current customers than to attract new ones. It is necessary to predict whether the client will leave the bank in the near future or not. You are provided with historical data on customer behavior and termination of agreements with the bank.| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-brithgreen) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Pandas-blue) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-ScikitLearn-yellow) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Matplotlib-9cf) ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/-NumPy-orange) |`Business`, `Investments`, `Banking`, `Bank lending`|
